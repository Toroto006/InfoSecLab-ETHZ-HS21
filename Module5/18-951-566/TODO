3b tripple check those internal offsets are okay
4a address buffer in bss hardcoded okay??
4b hardcoding bin sh offset? How to do it with r.libc
4c same bin sh as 4b and then how to get text base
5a again same text base for rop gadgets
6b double check that the jump bug addr is fine (should be as it is a no PIE)
