# InfoSecLab ETHZ HS21

This repository was for my solution to the modules of the Information Security Lab HS2021 (263-0009-00L) at ETH Zurich.
The following are the percentages I reached with these solutions (of which only 5 were needed for final grade):
 - Module 1 100.00 %	 
 - Module 2  87.00 %	 
 - Module 3 100.00 %
 - Module 4  65.00 %
 - Module 5	100.00 %	
 - Module 6 100.00 %	 

As these modules took a lot of time to just get working no code cleanup was done.

Credit for all exercises themselves goes to the course Information Security Lab HS2021 (263-0009-00L) at ETHZ.
